# covidIowa

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repository is to give a county-level summary of
COVID-19 cases in Iowa. The data is taken from a series of daily
snapshots of the [accessibility
page](https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/pages/access) provided by the Iowa
Department of Public Health.

I think that, for this dataset, **cases** means positive *tests*, not
positive *individuals*, as this
[comment](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/issues/546#issuecomment-784247266)
by the NYT data team indicates. All I know is that small numbers are
good and big numbers are bad.

If you want to work with the data yourself, all the code I use is
published this repository, check out the [`workflow`](workflow)
directory. Processed datasets are also available here:

  - [`iowa_county_meta.csv`](https://github.com/ijlyttle/covidIowa/blob/master/workflow/data/99-publish/iowa_county_meta.csv):
    county metadata, things like estimated 2019 population from
    [ICIP](https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/population/counties-estimates)
    at Iowa State University.

  - [`iowa_county_data.csv`](https://github.com/ijlyttle/covidIowa/blob/master/workflow/data/99-publish/iowa_county_data.csv):
    daily numbers by county from IDPH, going back to 2020-05-25.

  - [`iowa_county_cases_week.csv`](https://github.com/ijlyttle/covidIowa/blob/master/workflow/data/99-publish/iowa_county_data.csv):
    In addition to county metadata, total positive-tests (and per 100k),
    one week average of daily positive-tests (and per 100k), and
    week-over-week change in positive tests (as a ratio).

  - [`iowa_cases_week.csv`](https://github.com/ijlyttle/covidIowa/blob/master/workflow/data/99-publish/iowa_county_data.csv):
    Similar to `iowa_county_cases_week.csv`, but aggregated for the
    entire state.

## Tables as of 2021-03-01

I believe these numbers refer to positive tests, not to newly-reported
positive individuals.

For the entire state, over the past week:
