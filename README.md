# covidIowa

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repository is to give a county-level summary of
COVID-19 cases in Iowa. The data is taken from a series of daily
snapshots of the [accessibility
page](https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/pages/access) provided by the Iowa
Department of Public Health.

If you want to work with the data yourself, all the code I use is
published this repository, check out the [`workflow`](workflow)
directory. Processed datasets are also available here:

  - [`iowa_county_meta.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ijlyttle/covidIowa/master/workflow/data/99-publish/iowa_county_meta.csv):
    county metadata, things like estimated 2019 population from
    [ICIP](https://www.icip.iastate.edu/tables/population/counties-estimates)
    at Iowa State University.

  - [`iowa_county_data.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ijlyttle/covidIowa/master/workflow/data/99-publish/iowa_county_data.csv):
    daily numbers by county from IDPH, going back to 2020-05-25.

  - [`iowa_county_cases_week.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ijlyttle/covidIowa/master/workflow/data/99-publish/iowa_county_data.csv):
    In addition to county metadata, total positive-tests (and per 100k),
    one week average of daily positive-tests (and per 100k), and
    week-over-week change in positive tests (as a ratio).

  - [`iowa_cases_week.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ijlyttle/covidIowa/master/workflow/data/99-publish/iowa_cases_week.csv):
    Similar to `iowa_county_cases_week.csv`, but aggregated for the
    entire state.
